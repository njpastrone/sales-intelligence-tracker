# Investor Relations Signal Research

Research findings on what signals matter most to Investor Relations Officers (IROs).

## Executive Summary

The current signal categories (leadership, funding, expansion, etc.) are **sales-focused** — designed to identify outreach opportunities. IR officers have fundamentally different needs centered on **stock price impact, shareholder surveillance, and competitive intelligence**.

## IRO Pain Points (2024-2025)

Based on industry surveys and research:

| Pain Point | % Citing | Source |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Passive investing growth | 49% | Irwin State of IR 2024 |
| Stock market volatility | Top 3 | Irwin State of IR 2024 |
| ESG reporting complexity | Top 3 | Irwin State of IR 2024 |
| Retail investor engagement | 33% find difficult | IR Impact 2025 |

**Key insight**: IROs spend too much time on backward-looking internal reports instead of proactive investor engagement.

## What IROs Actually Monitor

### 1. Shareholder Base Surveillance (Highest Priority)

Early warning of ownership changes before they become problems.

**Signals to track:**
- Activist accumulation patterns
- 13-D/13-G beneficial ownership filings
- Institutional ownership shifts (quarterly 13-F changes)
- Short interest spikes
- Unusual trading volume

**Why it matters:**
- 84% of investors cite poor governance as the #1 activism trigger
- IRO presence associated with 20-40% lower tender offer likelihood
- Activists increasingly sophisticated at avoiding early detection

### 2. Analyst Coverage & Sentiment

Sell-side analysts are the conduit to the investment community.

**Signals to track:**
- Rating upgrades/downgrades
- Price target revisions (especially consensus moves)
- New coverage initiations
- Coverage drops
- Estimate revisions (EPS, revenue)

**Why it matters:**
- Rating changes create immediate stock price momentum
- IROs need to respond quickly to downgrades
- Consensus estimate changes affect market expectations

### 3. Peer & Competitor Intelligence

95% of IROs regularly gather information on competitors (CIRI survey).

**Signals to track:**
- Peer earnings results and guidance
- Competitor M&A activity
- Peer executive changes
- Industry trend commentary from peer calls
- Market share shifts

**Why it matters:**
- Sets context for own company's performance
- Analysts compare peers constantly
- Questions from peer calls predict your own Q&A

### 4. Regulatory & Material Events

8-K filings required within 4 business days of material events.

**Signals to track:**
- Executive departures (especially sudden)
- Auditor changes (red flag)
- Material contract wins/losses
- Cybersecurity incidents (now required disclosure)
- Delisting warnings
- SEC comment letters

**Why it matters:**
- Late filings erode investor trust
- Can lead to SEC fines or exchange delisting
- Reputational damage from surprises

### 5. Governance & ESG

**Signals to track:**
- Board composition changes
- Executive compensation controversies
- Proxy advisory recommendations (ISS, Glass Lewis)
- ESG rating changes (MSCI, Sustainalytics)
- Shareholder proposal filings

**Why it matters:**
- Poor governance is #1 activism trigger
- ESG now in top 3 IRO challenges
- Proxy season requires year-round preparation

### 6. Capital Markets Activity

**Signals to track:**
- Equity offerings (dilution)
- Debt issuance/refinancing
- Dividend changes (cuts especially negative)
- Buyback announcements
- Insider transactions (Form 4)

**Why it matters:**
- Directly affects shareholder returns

## IR-Focused Scoring Model

Instead of "sales relevance," use:

### Stock Impact Score (0-1.0)
How likely to move the stock price?
- **0.8-1.0**: Analyst downgrade, earnings miss, activist filing
- **0.5-0.7**: Executive change, guidance revision
- **0.2-0.4**: Peer news, industry trends
- **0.0-0.2**: General mentions, routine filings

### Action Required Score (0-1.0)
Does the IRO need to respond?
- **0.8-1.0**: Analyst downgrade, proxy advisory warning, activist campaign
- **0.5-0.7**: Peer earnings (prepare talking points), coverage initiation
- **0.2-0.4**: Industry news, ESG report
- **0.0-0.2**: Routine peer updates

### Urgency Score (0-1.0)
How time-sensitive?
- **0.8-1.0**: 8-K deadline, active proxy fight, analyst call request
- **0.5-0.7**: Upcoming earnings, shareholder meeting prep
- **0.2-0.4**: Quarterly ownership analysis
- **0.0-0.2**: Annual ESG report, general monitoring

## Next Steps

To pivot this tool from sales to IR:

1. **Update signal categories** in `config.py` to IR-focused types
2. **Revise classification prompt** to identify IR-relevant signals
3. **Change scoring** from "sales relevance" to "stock impact" + "action required"
4. **Add peer tracking** — monitor competitor companies, not just own watchlist
5. **Integrate filing sources** — SEC EDGAR RSS for 8-K, 13-D, 13-F filings
